How applications can leverage services on azure platform.

As a developer we need to develop the application on local machine using any language s.a. .NET, PHP, Java, Python
Once the application is in place, the application needs to deploy.

Section 1
------------
Ur application needs to deploy onto some sort of compute infrastructure.

1. How do we deploy application on Azure virtual Machine.
2. Azure Website -> This is a manged service for hosting web applications.
3. Container -> You can also containerize and host your applications.
4. Function Apps -> U can define functions and host them using azure functions.

Section 2
-------------
Deploy application on azure.
Example: Aspnet core 8, PHP
We will deploy these applications on Azure VM.
VS code as development tool.

Virtual Machine
---------------------------
Deploy Virtual Machine 
Connect to this VM via RDP
Create ASP.Net Aplicaion in VS code
Install IIS on Virtual machine
 --> How ? Go to server Manager -> Add Roles & features -> Next -> Next -> (Server Roles) -> Select "Web Server" -> Add Features -> Next ->
           Next -> Install -> close [Web Server in place -> 19.chapt]
Go to Network Settings -> Add inbound Rule -> HTTP, 80(port_number) -> (All incoming request via port 80 should allow)
Copy Public IP address -> Add it in new Tab -> can now see web page from IIS.

Host our application(dot net application)
------------------------------------------
Step 1:
On server side also need to install Dot Net, Install .Net Runtime. For this, we need to install ASP.NET HOSTING BUNDLE.
Go to Server Manager -> Local server -> (IE enhanced Security config: OFF)
Open Internel Explorer(IE) -> Start without your data -> Continue and start browsing -> search (ASP.Net Hosting Bundle) -> (.Net Core Hosting Bundle) -> Download and Install.

Step 2: 
On the C:\ drive create a folder C:\learningapp -> 

Step 3: 
Go to Server Manager -> Tools -> IIS -> Go to Sites -> click on it -> click on Default Website -> Select it -> Binding Settings (Select from RHS) -> Chose curent binding -> Edit -> diff port number than 80 i.e.8080 -> Ok.

Step 4:
I want to create a new website which listens to default port 80.
Create a Add website and chose physical path as c:\learningapp (rt click on sites ->Add Website)

Step 5: (Goal: On VS core -> publish a build )
On VS core -> Create a new terminal -> go to the path C:\temp2\learningpath\dotnet publish -c release -0 ./bin/publish
(By using above command runnable version of project is created.)

Step 6:(Goal: Copy publish folder in learningapp folder of VM) chapt.20.
Go to our desktop -> appvm -> right click Edit(Instead of Connect, chose Edit) -> Select "Local Resources" Tab -> click on More -> Select Drives -> chose C:\ drive -> Connect.
Got to VM -> File Explorer -> u can see desktop C:\ drive is visible in Virtual Machine -> copy publish folder content in C:\learningPath

Step 7: publish public ip address of VM on browser -> u can see the web application.
