How applications can leverage services on azure platform.

As a developer we need to develop the application on local machine using any language s.a. .NET, PHP, Java, Python
Once the application is in place, the application needs to deploy.

Section 1
------------
Ur application needs to deploy onto some sort of compute infrastructure.

1. How do we deploy application on Azure virtual Machine.
2. Azure Website -> This is a manged service for hosting web applications.
3. Container -> You can also containerize and host your applications.
4. Function Apps -> U can define functions and host them using azure functions.

Section 2
-------------
Deploy application on azure.
Example: Aspnet core 8, PHP
We will deploy these applications on Azure VM.
VS code as development tool.

Virtual Machine
---------------------------
Deploy Virtual Machine 
Connect to this VM via RDP
Create ASP.Net Aplicaion in VS code
Install IIS on Virtual machine
 --> How ? Go to server Manager -> Add Roles & features -> Next -> Next -> (Server Roles) -> Select "Web Server" -> Add Features -> Next ->
           Next -> Install -> close [Web Server in place]
Go to Network Settings -> Add inbound Rule -> HTTP, 80(port_number) -> (All incoming request via port 80 should allow)
Copy Public IP address -> Add it in new Tab -> can now see web page from IIS.

Host our application(dot net application)
------------------------------------------
On server side also need to install Dot Net, Install .Net Runtime. For this, we need to install ASP.NET HOSTING BUNDLE.
Go to Server Manager -> Local server -> (IE enhanced Security config: OFF)
Open Internel Explorer(IE) -> Start without your data -> Continue and start browsing -> search (ASP.Net Hosting Bundle) -> Download and Install.

Go to Server Manager -> Tools -> IIS -> Go to Default Website -> Select it -> Binding Settings
